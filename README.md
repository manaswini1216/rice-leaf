🌾 Rice Disease Prediction
This project focuses on detecting and classifying rice leaf diseases using deep learning. It helps farmers and researchers identify the type and severity of disease from rice leaf images for early treatment and better crop management.

🧠 Project Overview
Using image classification techniques, the model predicts the type of rice disease from leaf images. The disease classes include:

Bacterial Leaf Blight(mild/severe)

Brown Spot(mild/severe)

Leaf Smut(mild/severe)

Healthy

🗃️ Dataset
Dataset used:
📎 Severity-Based Rice Leaf Diseases Dataset – Kaggle

Contains 1200+ images categorized by disease type and severity

Images are labeled and structured into folders by class

🔧 Features
Preprocessing and augmentation of rice leaf images

Custom CNN or Transfer Learning model (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)

Classification across disease types and severity levels

Streamlit app for real-time image-based predictions
